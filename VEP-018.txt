Term: hyper-dynamic-spectrum
Action: Addition
Label: Hyper Dynamic Spectrum
Description: A three-dimensional dataset extending a dynamic spectrum (a time axis and a spectral axis) 
with a third relative temporal axis (usually a higher resolution time-series).
Relationships: narrower than #dynamic-spectrum, narrower than #cube
Used-in: ivoa.obscore table at http://vogate.obs-nancay.fr/tap

Rationale:

The new term is porposed by the Nancay and Orleans pulsar team to describe the pulsar basic datasets.
They are composed of 2 dimensional arrays of relative time-series. The main axes are the time (either
absolute times or periodic time) and a spectral axis. Each temporal and spectral sample is a 
time-series. The same type of data layout exists for radar planetary radars, where each time and 
frequency point is a time-series of the observed pulse echo. The Mars-Express/MARSIS/AIS dataset is 
an example of such product type (although is it nos -yet- available in an obscore table).
