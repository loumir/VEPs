New Term: event-bundle
Action: Addition 
Label: Event list  with associated calibration files
Description:  A data product type that agregates an event-list data product
to other files that describe instrumental response functions for calibration and analysis. 
This is can be implemented as an archive file or other compressed formats.
Relationships: is related to the event-list data product type 

Used-in: The distribution of event-list data in multi-messenger astronomy. 
For example, Chandra primary products distributed via the Chandra
Data Archive include around half a dozen different types of products neces-
sary to analyse Chandra data (for example, L2 event-list, Aspect solution,
bad pixel map, spacecraft ephemeris, V&V Report).
For VHE gamma rays and neutrinos, the DL3 event-lists should manda-
torily be associated to their associated IRFs files. The links between the
event-list and these IRFs should be well defined in the event-bundle.

Rationale:
Event-list data products distributed by High Energy surveys 
need additionnal information to be calibrated and analysed. 
Instrumental and observations functions must be available together 
with the data in order to interpret the event-list content.
